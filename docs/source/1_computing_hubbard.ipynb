    "We can divide this goal in three phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Define the manifolds__: define the target Hubbard manifolds via the {{ hubbard_structure }}\n",
    "* __SCF ground-state__: calculate the ground-state using the {py:class}`~aiida_quantumespresso.workflows.pw.base.PwBaseWorkChain`\n",
    "* __DFPT calculation__: use the {py:class}`~aiida_hubbard.workflow.hp.base.HpBaseWorkChain` to do a self-consistent perturbation calculation to predict the Hubbard parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will make use of the silicon structure to give you an overall understanding of the usage of the package.\n",

    "The Hubbard correction is a corrective term that is added to the Hamiltonian of a system\n",
    "which suffers from great __self-interaction errors__. This is usually the case for transition\n",
    "metals on their _d_ manifolds. An extra correction to account for the hybridization can be accounted\n",
    "for with the ligands, typically belonging to the _p_ element group. Such interaction needs to be\n",
    "localized in space. This is the reason why we need to define the __projectors__. Quantum ESPRESSO\n",
    "allows you to define different type of projections $| \\phi^I_m \\rangle$ ($m$ orbital quantum number, $I$ atom in cell). Currently, the __ortho-atomic__ projectors\n",
    "are the most accurate ones implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, we need to ask the program on _which atoms_ $I$ and _which manifolds_ $m$ to project and correct for this\n",

    "2. To do a _full_ self-consistent calculation of these parameters, you should _relax_ your structure with the Hubbard parameters from the `hp.x` run, repeat the steps of this tutorial, relax _again_, and do this procedure over and over till convergence.\n",
